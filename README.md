The Onion Architecture is a software architectural pattern that emphasizes the separation of concerns within an application. It was introduced by Jeffrey Palermo in 2008 and is particularly popular in the .NET community. The main idea behind the Onion Architecture is to structure your application in layers, where each layer has a specific responsibility and dependencies flow inward, mimicking the layers of an onion.

Here's a simplified explanation of how the Onion Architecture works:

**Core (Innermost Layer):**

At the core of the Onion Architecture lies the domain model or business logic. This layer contains entities, value objects, domain services, and any other domain-specific logic.
The core layer should be completely independent of any external concerns such as UI, databases, or frameworks. It should define the fundamental rules and behavior of your application.

**Domain Services:**

This layer encapsulates the application-specific business rules and workflows that are not tied to any particular entity.
Domain services act as orchestrators of domain logic and coordinate interactions between domain objects.

**Application Services:**

The application services layer sits above the domain layer and provides an interface for external clients (e.g., UI, API) to interact with the domain model.
Application services are responsible for handling incoming requests, invoking domain logic, and returning responses. They act as a bridge between the presentation layer and the domain layer.

**Infrastructure (Outermost Layer):**

The infrastructure layer contains components responsible for interacting with external systems such as databases, file systems, external services, etc.
This layer includes implementations of repositories, data access logic, external API clients, etc.
In your case, since you specified no need for a database, you can use in-memory data structures or lists to simulate data storage within this layer.

**Presentation (Optional):**

While not always included in the core Onion Architecture, a presentation layer may be added for user interface concerns.
This layer includes components such as controllers, views, view models, and UI logic.
The presentation layer interacts with the application services layer to fetch data and handle user input.

**Benefits of Onion Architecture include:**

Testability: The separation of concerns makes it easier to test individual components in isolation.
Maintainability: Changes to one layer do not necessarily affect other layers, promoting maintainability and scalability.
Flexibility: The architecture allows for swapping out components in one layer without affecting others, providing flexibility in technology choices.
